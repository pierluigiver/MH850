FLIGHT SIMULATOR MH850 FIXED-WING DRONE

Welcome to the MH850 FLIGHT SIMULATOR. This version is in Italian, and it needs to be updated.
To produce some results, it is convenient to use the executable file called 'FlightSimulator.exe' directly located in the folder 'cmake-build-debug.'
The simulator is divided into pre-processing, processing, and post-processing.
You will not need to set the pre-processing and processing to work directly on the code because you will need to follow the instructions on the prompt. 
After the simulation is done, you should see the results. For this sake, a Matlab file to open and run is located in the folder 'cmake-build-debug' folder called Plot.m.
